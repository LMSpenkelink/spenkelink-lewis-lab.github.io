The Single-molecule discussion club brings together single-molecule groups in New South Wales, giving researchers the opportunity to share news, tips, and tricks. The club is an initiative that originated when Antoine van Oijen and Till Boecking were both at Harvard. In 2015, when they both found themselves in Australia, they established a UNSW-UOW version. After a short hiatus during Covid, the club is now growing to include more and more single-molecule groups within New South Wales.
