How do mitochondria replicate their DNA? We are excited to share that our lab has been awarded an ARC Discovery Project Grant to tackle this fundamental question! Postdoc & PhD opportunities coming soon!

<!--more-->

This project aims to study the molecular mechanisms of the mitochondrial replisome, the set of proteins that copy mitochondrial DNA. While DNA replication in the cell nucleus has been extensively studied for decades, processes that define mitochondrial DNA replication are poorly understood. This interdisciplinary effort will merge cutting-edge cryo-EM with novel single-molecule biophysical tools to establish the architecture of human mitochondrial replication and define how it coordinates synthesis of the two DNA strands. Expected outcomes of this project include a high-resolution understanding of a fundamental biological process, development of novel biophysical methodology, and training of the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.
