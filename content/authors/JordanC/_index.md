Jordan Cater obtained his PhD in 2021, after which he worked as a researcher in the motor neuron disease lab of Prof. Justin Yerbury and Dr. Luke McAlary. His projects involved screening drug efficacy in cell culture models of disease-linked SOD1 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 

His research in our lab focusses on the development of fluorescent biosensors. To support this research he has been awarded an AEGIS Advance Grant (2024) and Molecular Horizons Collaborative grants (2024).
