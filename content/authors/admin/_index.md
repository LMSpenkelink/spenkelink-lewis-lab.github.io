Lisanne is a single-molecule biophysisist working on the development of single-molecule tools to visualise dynamics in complex biological systems. She aims to bring together expertise from the fields of physics, chemistry, and biology to help solve important medical challenges facing the world today.

She obtained her BSc and MSc in physics in the Netherlands and obtained a joint PhD degree from the Universities of Groningen and Wollongong in 2018. She is now a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Wollongong. Her lab focusses on two core interests: the dynamic process of DNA replication and disease diagnostics. In 2022, she was awarded an NHMRC Investigator grant to design a novel single-molecule directed-evolution approach.
